The gameplay of The Maze Runner: Gladers' Escape is focused on speedrunning and platforming challenges. Players must complete each level as quickly as possible to earn better rewards. The game features a timer that tracks the player's progress, and faster level completion yields better rewards.

Each level has different types of enemies that the player must defeat or avoid. However, if the player ignores some enemies, they may follow the player into the next level, making it even more challenging. Additionally, there is a hurt system where the player's HP decreases as they take damage. The lower the player's HP, the slower they move, making it harder to complete the level.

The Maze Runner: Gladers' Escape also features a range of unique mechanics, including the ability to climb walls, jump heights, dash from enemies, grapple the walls, and more. The game also features enemies that are in the background and can take a special interest in the player and jump to the foreground, adding an extra layer of challenge to the game.
