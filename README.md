## Gameplay

The gameplay of *The Maze Runner: Gladers' Escape* is focused on constant movement and exploration of levels. The player should find their way through the maze's walls within the time limit. **Faster level completion yields better rewards.** Good performance in each "level" in the *The Maze Runner: Gladers' Escape* warrants gifts sent from The Box (an elevator that brings new Gladers) and from the maze's "Creators". These gifts range from *food items* (temporary powerups) to *weapons* for the player to use to defeat enemies.

Each level has different types of enemies that the player must defeat or avoid. However, if the player avoids *some* specific enemies, they may follow them into the next level, making it even more challenging. Additionally, there is a health/hurting system where the player's HP decreases as they take damage and the lower the player's HP, the slower they move, making it harder to complete the level.

The game also features a range of unique mechanics, including the ability to climb walls, jump heights, dash, grapple the walls, and more. The game, furthermore, features enemies that are in the background and can take a special interest in the player and jump to the foreground, adding an extra layer of surprise to the game.

## Art Style and Graphics

*The Maze Runner: Gladers' Escape* is drawn in a charming pixel art style and developed in the Unity Engine. The game's visual style is inspired by The Maze Runner movies' looks and is designed to appeal to fans of the series.
